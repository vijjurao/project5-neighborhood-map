A map of 10 golf courses near my city. I made use of the Yelp API to populate infowindows with locations, ratings, reviews, pictures, and addresses.

A search bar filters the golf courses by name. Clicking on the list will open the locations corresponding marker's infowindow. The markers can be clicked as well to display the infowindow with the Yelp content about that location.
